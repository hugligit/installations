Installing Debian Linux on Home Computers
=========================================

When the installation process involves searching for information in
various places and scrambling resources from half forgotten locations then
the whole process becomes rather painful.  The installation requires
a dedicated time without distractions for figuring out the details. When
time like this is not available it can delay the, often necessary,
installation by months. 

I'd like to avoid that. This guide should be able to show all necessary
steps for setting up a working system on a computer. All necessary
commands will be included and explained. As for the external resources I'd
like to use as few as possible.

This guide will use the official Debian repositories, a few Github hosted
projects and, unfortunately, a few sources where manual intervention might
be necessary.

So ideally, all it takes is to follow the steps, execute a few commands
and the rest should depend only on computer speed, the internet connection
speed and the reliability of the repositories. With a bit of luck a new
system can be set up in few hours.
